1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how LinkGauge (“we”, “our”, or “us”), operated by Richard as a sole proprietorship, processes information when users interact with the LinkGauge application.

LinkGauge is a testing and educational project, created for research, experimentation, and learning purposes related to LinkedIn’s API ecosystem.
The application is not intended for commercial use, and no personal user data is stored, sold, rented, or used for marketing.

We are committed to respecting user privacy and adhering to LinkedIn’s API Terms, as well as general data protection principles.

2. Purpose of the Application

LinkGauge is designed to:

Test LinkedIn’s authentication (OAuth 2.0)

Retrieve non-personal organization analytics data, such as impressions on posts

Explore how LinkedIn’s API works for educational purposes

Demonstrate how analytics can be processed and visualized

The application is not intended to handle any personal information, does not offer user accounts, and does not profile or track users.

3. Information We Collect

LinkGauge does not collect, store, or process any personal data such as:

Names

Email addresses

LinkedIn profile details

Connections or contacts

Messages

Demographic information

✔ The only retrieved data is:

Organization-level analytics provided through the LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform

Metrics such as impressions, clicks, likes, comments

Public identifiers like organization URN or post URN

✔ These data points:

Are non-personal

Do not identify any LinkedIn members

Are only accessible with the explicit permission of the organization page admin

4. OAuth Authentication

LinkGauge uses LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 exclusively for:

Verifying that a user is an admin of their Company Page

Retrieving analytics that LinkedIn permits through their official APIs

We do NOT:

Store access tokens permanently

Share tokens with third parties

Collect personal data during authorization

OAuth tokens are used temporarily in the testing session and may be stored only in secure, local memory for short-lived operational purposes.

5. How We Use Data

The limited analytics data retrieved via LinkedIn is used only for:

Testing API functionality

Demonstrating data queries

Learning how LinkedIn analytics can be visualized or integrated into tools like Python scripts or Power BI

Non-commercial research

We do not use analytics for decision-making about individuals.
We do not use analytics for marketing or advertising.
We do not use analytics to evaluate or track LinkedIn users.

6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share any data with:

Third-party companies

Advertisers

External developers

Analytics services

The retrieved LinkedIn data remains solely within the testing environment.

7. Data Storage and Security

LinkGauge does not maintain a database.

No personal data is saved to disk or transmitted externally.

Any analytics data is processed in-memory during testing only.

Once a session ends, all data is discarded.

OAuth tokens, when used, are safeguarded and not stored beyond the active session.

8. Educational and Testing Use Disclaimer

LinkGauge is an experimental and educational project.

Accordingly:

The application may be incomplete or unstable

The app is not intended for production or public deployment

Users should not rely on it for business-critical analytics

The purpose is to understand API mechanics, data structures, and technical integrations

All usage is at the user’s discretion, with no guarantees.

9. LinkedIn API Compliance

LinkGauge fully adheres to:

LinkedIn API Terms of Use

LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform guidelines

Restrictions regarding personal data

Limitations on LinkedIn profile access

We only access data explicitly permitted by LinkedIn and granted by the user.

10. User Rights

Because LinkGauge does not store personal data:

No deletion requests are needed

No data correction mechanisms are required

No personal data export is provided

Users may revoke LinkedIn access at any time via:

LinkedIn Settings → Data Privacy → Other Applications
